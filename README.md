# Data-Analyst-Portfolio
Hi, I'm Ivan! I have a computer and technology background and hold a Bachelor Degree in Mechatronics Engineering (Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education). Throughout my life I've always been in daily exposure to software and computers and I always looked for ways to organize my life and make everything easier. I love Excel and a year ago I started to learn Python, SQL and Tableau and I am currently building a portfolio to share my experience and get my foot on the door for a new job.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
